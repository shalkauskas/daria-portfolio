          Nassan’s Place is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that is helping to
          make a difference in the lives of children and families affected by
          autism in and around under-served communities by providing educational
          and recreational programs, social outings, and resources. The
          organization was founded 9 years ago by Nadine Wright-Arbubakkr, a
          mother of an autistic child, 16-year old Nassan, so parents wouldn’t
          have to struggle to find affordable programs and services as she did.

          Although at this project I was the only designer, the collaboration
          was still a huge thing. I was mostly communicating with the founder of
          the Nassan’s Place, Nadine, and a parent, Deena, who had not only
          created the original website in Wix but also has been maintaining it
          for all these years. Thus my design has to be easy to update for a
          person without a technical background.

          After I published a new website, Deena and I had a few Zoom meetings
          when I was teaching her to make changes on the website. Now, she is
          successfully maintaining a new website using the guide I specifically
          prepared for her. According to the surveys, users are happy with the
          updated website.

            Faced multiple technical constraints of Wix along the process that
            basically dictated some of the design solutions.

            Everyone I interacted with (client, users and content manager) were
            busy moms who did their best combining work and taking care of
            autistic kids so scheduling time for meetings and interviews was
            tricky from time to time. I really appreciate that they were still
            able to participate in user interviews and were willing to help from
            the heart.
