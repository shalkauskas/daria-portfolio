        Learning Seeds is the social benefit corporation known for the
        Enlightened Shadowing Method of social coaching for kids. Due to the
        high volume, they currently have an 8-month waitlist for their services.
        Parents need a way to learn enough of the Enlightened Shadowing Method
        so that they will be able to implement aspects of it with their own
        children and experience progress and relief.

    ),
    hypothesis: (
      <div>
        We believe that by creating a micro-course that scales the learnability
        of the Enlightened Shadow Method, we will enable parents to successfully
        implement this method as part of their own parenting toolkit.
      </div>
    ),
    outcomes: (
      <div>
        Parents (our users) got an opportunity to learn the Enlightened Shadow
        Method while still being on a waitlist. Besides that, using the
        micro-course they can save the pieces of information for their future
        reference as well as take notes and track their progress. Each lesson
        ends with the reflection form that allows them to record what tips and
        practices worked best for their children.
