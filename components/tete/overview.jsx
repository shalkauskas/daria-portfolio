        <b>Tete-A-Tete salon</b> is a local hairsalon serving the Newton area
        since 1999. The main purpose of having a website for Tete-A-Tete is
        providing the information necessary for visiting the salon. That means
        that the website is supposed to answer the majority of questions
        perspective clients may have. However, the surveys have shown that users
        often have difficulties navigating the website and have no other choice
        but to contact the salon in order to get info.
