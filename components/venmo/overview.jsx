          Venmo users need a fast and easy way to donate to charities that
          resonate with them. We believe that by adding a donation feature for
          Venmo Superusers, we will enable them to donate more easily. We will
          know this to be true when we see 20% of Venmo users donate at least
          once a month.

            As we discovered that people are more likely to donate when they are
            asked to do so, we give users an opportunity to donate each time
            they are making regular Venmo transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to make donating as painless and seamless as possible, we
            offer users to donate a set amount of just $1.

            Users can donate more if they choose to visit the page of the cause.
