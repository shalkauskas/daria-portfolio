          <p class="about-paragraph">I am a multilingual UX/UI designer with a passion for understanding peopleâ€™s needs.
            Being an <b>enthusiastic</b> and <b>hard-working</b> specialist I am always excited to start a new project treating
            challenges with a <b>can-do attitude.</b></p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">People are <b>social</b> creatures and I am not an exception.
            It is a pleasure for me to work with competent professionals
            learning and evolving every single day. My experience of being part of <b>intercultural teams</b> helps me to establish and build
            trusting relationships with international partners and outsource teams as well.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraph"><b>Caring for others</b> is what makes me happy either while cooking yummies for my family
            or planning fun events with friends. In my free time, you also can find me hiking in New Hampshire or
            kayaking down the Charles River as I love being active and keep moving!</p>
